Pepper v{pepper-version} - {git-commit-id-abbrev}

:toc:

Pepper is a project management tool.

It allows creating data related to your project and represents the data with Gantt, Form and boards like Daily, Kanban or OKR.

As `Pepper` is based on Sirius Web application, please refer to the  https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/sirius-web.html[Sirius Web documentation] for more details.

== Concepts

The core concept is the `Project`.
It contains:

* many attributes to describe the `Project` such as planning, cost or stakeholder information.
* a list of `Workpackages`
* a list of `Risks`
A `Risk` is associated to one or many `Workpackages`
* a list of `Objectives`

A `Workpackage` contains

* a list of `WorkpackageArtefact`
* a list of `Tasks`.
`Tasks` is a fine-grained concept to describe the `Workpackage` 

At root level, you can create `Organizations` that own the `Projects` and `ResourceFolders` which contain `Persons`, `Teams`, `InternalStakeholders` and `ExternalStakeholders`.

== Starter

To start the user need to create a Sirius project that will contain a model containing the concepts.
By default, a blank model is created.
You can add a new model by adding a blank or a sample model.
The sample model is useful to see the concepts that are possible to create.

== Representations

Once you have created the model, you can create representations of your model.
Representation is the core feature that will help display and edit your data.

You can create a representation using the contextual menu on the object.

In `Gantt` on `Project`, the Gantt tasks represent the `Workpackage` of the `Project`.

In `Gantt` on `Workpackage`, the Gantt tasks represent the `Tasks` and sub `Tasks` of the `Workpackage`.

You can 

* create new tasks
* change the dates of the task by moving the task or changing in `Details` panel
* reorder existing tasks or change the parent of a task

=== Deck on Project and Workpackage

A `Deck` representation is a representation which have columns and card inside columns.
The cards can be moved from a column to another.

==== OKR

The `OKR` representation can be created from a `Project` or a `Workpackage`.
The columns represent the `Objectives` contained in the Project or Workpackage and the cards represent the `KeyResult`.

The columns represent the `TaskTags` (with _daily_ prefix) contained in the `TagFolder` and the cards represent the `Tasks` that have a reference to the corresponding `TaskTag`.


==== Kanban
